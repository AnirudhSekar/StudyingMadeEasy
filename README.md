# StudyingMadeBetter
This is an app that I developed for the Congressional App Challenge that can make studying and practicing for tests much easier and more fun than traditional methods! 
My app makes studying a lot more efficient and easy for students all over the globe. My app is split into two screens, one called Create and one called Test. The create screen has components that can receive input for both the question and answer to a specific term that a student is trying to memorize. These terms can be edited or deleted if the user chooses to do so. All the terms that a user has is displayed on the Create Screen as well. The Test screen allows the students to quiz themselves on the terms that they entered earlier. For example, if I entered, "What is the capital of Texas?" for the question, and "Austin" for the answer, I would be asked the question that I entered, and be expected to enter the answer. Once the user is done answering all the questions, the program grades your performance, and returns a percentage and the number of questions correct. 
Using this app, students don't have to spend much time studying because their method of study is far more efficient and productive.
